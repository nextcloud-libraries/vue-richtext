This library provides a simple vue component to render text with rich placeholder replacements.
The parameters that are replaced can either be a string or an object that allows rendering any Vue component into the text.
Placeholders are wrapped in brackets, like `{placeholder}`.
Markdown can be used for basic text formatting.

## Installation

```sh
npm install --save @juliushaertl/vue-richtext
```

## Basic usage with simple text placeholders

- Input string: `The file {file} was added…`
- Arguments:
  - file: `'MyDocument'`
- Renders: `The file 'MyDocument' was added…`

## Usage with vue components

- Input string: `The file {file} was added by {username}`
- Arguments:
  - file: `'MyDocument'`
  - username: `{ component: User, props: { username: 'Jane Doe' }`
- Renders: `The file 'MyDocument' was added by <User>Jane Doe</User>`

## Usage with markdown

- Input string: `The **file** *{file}* was added by {username}`
- Arguments:
  - file: `'MyDocument'`
  - username: `{ component: User, props: { username: 'Jane Doe' }`
- Renders: `The <strong>file</strong> <i>'MyDocument'</i> was added by <User>Jane Doe</User>`
